Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)

Definition

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a standardized set of laws governing commercial transactions in the United States. It is designed to provide consistency and clarity across state laws in areas such as sales, leasing, banking, and secured transactions. While the UCC is not federal law, it has been adopted in some form by all 50 states, including Florida, Colorado, and Arizona.

## How It Relates to Title

**UCC Liens:**
The UCC impacts title searches through UCC filings, which are recorded to secure interests in personal property or fixtures attached to real property. These filings may affect a property’s title if the secured asset is related to or installed on the real estate, such as equipment or fixtures.
Example: A creditor may file a UCC-1 financing statement to claim an interest in a restaurant's kitchen equipment, even if the equipment is installed in leased property.

**Title Examination:**
Title examiners must identify UCC filings that could encumber the property, particularly if fixtures (items attached to the property) are involved. UCC filings are typically recorded in a state’s central registry and are separate from traditional property deeds and liens.

---

## Key Articles of the UCC Related to Title

**1. Article 2: Sales of Goods**

Governs contracts for the sale of goods and may intersect with real property when goods are sold as part of a real estate transaction.
Example: A contract to sell a home that includes appliances or equipment may invoke UCC principles for those items.



**2. Article 9: Secured Transactions**

Covers security interests in personal property and fixtures. A creditor may file a UCC lien on fixtures attached to real estate.
Example: A bank lends money to a business for equipment and files a UCC-1 lien to secure its interest in the equipment, even if it becomes part of the real property.

---

## UCC-1 Financing Statement

**Definition:**
A UCC-1 financing statement is a legal form creditors file to publicly declare their interest in a debtor’s personal property or fixtures as collateral for a loan.

**Importance in Title Search:**
UCC-1 filings must be reviewed during a title search to ensure that no outstanding claims exist that could affect property rights.


## Example:
A solar panel company installs panels on a homeowner’s roof and files a UCC-1 lien to secure payment for the panels. If the homeowner sells the property, the lien must be resolved before closing.

---

When It Will Be **Recorded**

## UCC filings are typically recorded:

1. In the state where the debtor is located for personal property.

2. In the county or jurisdiction where the real property is located if fixtures are involved.

3. When a creditor provides financing for a property-related item and wishes to secure its interest

---

## Types of UCC Filings

**1. Personal Property Liens:**

Secures interests in movable goods.
**Example:** A lender finances a fleet of trucks and files a UCC lien on them.

**2. Fixture Filings:**

Secures interests in items attached to real estate, like HVAC systems or elevators.
Example: A company installs a commercial HVAC system and files a UCC lien to secure payment.

**3. Inventory Liens:**

Covers a business’s inventory as collateral.

**Example:** A retailer uses its stock of goods to secure a loan, and the lender files a UCC-1.

---

## Considerations for Title Examiners

**1. Verify Fixture Filings:**

Determine if UCC liens are filed on fixtures or equipment tied to the property.

**2. Check for Unresolved Liens:**

Ensure that any UCC liens are released or satisfied before transferring title.

**3. Distinguish Between Real and Personal Property:**

Identify whether the lien applies to personal property, fixtures, or real estate, as this affects how it impacts the title.

**4. Review Financing Statements:**

Confirm the validity and expiration of UCC filings, as they typically expire after five years unless continued.

---

### Impact on Property Transactions

**1. Title Clearance:**

UCC liens must be resolved to ensure clear title for buyers.

**Example:** A buyer purchasing a property with a solar energy system may require the seller to pay off the UCC lien before closing.

**2. Negotiations:**

UCC filings may lead to negotiations between buyers, sellers, and creditors to resolve outstanding claims.

**3. Potential Risks:**

If a UCC lien is not discovered during a title search, the new owner may inherit the obligation, potentially leading to legal disputes.

---
### Examples of UCC in Real Estate

**1. Business Property:**

A restaurant purchases kitchen equipment on credit, and the creditor files a UCC lien.

During a title search for the property sale, the lien is identified and must be resolved.

**2. Solar Panels:**

A homeowner finances solar panels through a company that files a UCC lien on the panels.

If the home is sold, the lien must be paid off or transferred to the buyer.

**3. Industrial Equipment:**

A manufacturing company installs machinery financed by a bank, which files a UCC lien.

The title examiner ensures that the lien is addressed during a property sale or refinancing.

---

### Key Takeaways

UCC filings are critical to consider in title searches, particularly for fixtures or personal property tied to real estate.

Title examiners must identify and resolve UCC liens to ensure clear and marketable title.

Proper review of UCC filings protects buyers and lenders from inheriting unresolved claims.

By addressing UCC-related issues early, property transactions proceed smoothly, and potential legal disputes are minimized.

## How the UCC Relates to a Title Search

In the context of a title search, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is significant because UCC filings may create liens or encumbrances on personal property, fixtures, or real property improvements that could affect ownership rights or property transfers. Here's a breakdown:

---

**1. Fixtures and Real Property**

**Definition:** Fixtures are items initially considered personal property but have become part of the real property due to installation (e.g., HVAC systems, solar panels).

**Relevance:** Title examiners must identify UCC filings related to these fixtures during the title search.

**Why It Matters:** A creditor’s claim on a fixture can impact the property’s marketability until the lien is resolved.

**Example:** If a solar panel company files a UCC lien on panels installed on a home, the lien must be addressed before the property can be sold or refinanced.

---

**2. Identification of UCC Liens**

**Purpose:** UCC filings are reviewed to ensure no outstanding claims affect the property’s title.

**Scope:** Title examiners check both the local recording office (county clerk or recorder’s office) and state UCC registries for potential liens.

**Example:** A business property with equipment used as collateral might have UCC liens recorded.

---

**3. Impact on Marketability of Title**

**Encumbrance Resolution:** Any UCC liens identified must be resolved to provide clear title to the buyer or lender.

**Example:** If a restaurant is sold, any UCC lien on kitchen equipment must be paid off or transferred to avoid affecting the buyer’s rights.

---

## 4. Types of UCC Filings Relevant to Title Search

**1. Fixture Filings:**

Recorded against items affixed to the real property.

**Example:** A company installs a commercial HVAC system and files a UCC lien.

**2. Personal Property Liens:**

May involve movable goods tied to the property or business.

**Example:** A creditor files a UCC lien on office furniture within a leased building.

**3. Inventory and Equipment Liens:**

Relevant for commercial properties.

**Example:** A retail store uses its inventory as collateral, leading to a UCC lien.

---

## 5. Resolution of UCC Liens in Title Search

### Required Actions:

1. Confirm the validity and priority of the lien.

2. Verify if the debt has been satisfied or if the lien has expired (usually after five years unless renewed).

3. Negotiate lien release or payoff as part of the closing process.


**Documentation Needed:**

UCC-3 form (Termination Statement) to show that the lien has been released.

---

**6. How UCC Filings Are Recorded**

**Where:** UCC liens may be recorded in state registries (e.g., Secretary of State) or county offices, depending on the property type.

**When:** A UCC filing is typically recorded when a creditor wants to secure an interest in collateral.

---

**7. Title Insurance and UCC Liens**

## Role of Title Insurance:
Title insurance policies often exclude UCC liens from coverage unless explicitly addressed. Identifying and resolving these liens during the title search ensures no surprises for the buyer or lender.

**Example:** A buyer of a commercial building ensures that any UCC liens on leased equipment are addressed to avoid future disputes.

---

**Summary:** Importance of UCC in Title Searches

By integrating **UCC findings** into the title examination process, property transactions are protected from hidden **financial risks**, ensuring a smooth and secure transfer of ownership.

The 30-year criteria is a key aspect of title searches in Florida, particularly for identifying and eliminating outdated claims, including liens, encumbrances, or other interests that affect real property. Here’s how it applies to mobile homes and UCC filings:


---

## 30-Year Criteria in Florida Title Searches

1. Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA):

Florida’s Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA) provides that any claims, liens, or encumbrances not properly preserved within 30 years from the root of title are extinguished.

This includes claims affecting mobile homes classified as real property if they are permanently affixed to the land.


2. Application to Mobile Homes:

If a mobile home is permanently affixed to land and classified as real property, the MRTA 30-year rule applies. Any lien, easement, or restriction older than 30 years that hasn’t been refiled or preserved in public records is no longer enforceable.

**Key Note:** This applies only to real property. Mobile homes still classified as personal property under Florida law are subject to UCC filing rules, not MRTA.

---

### How the 30-Year Rule Affects Title Searches for Mobile Homes

1. Permanently Affixed Mobile Homes (Real Property):

Any encumbrance, including old UCC filings, must have been renewed or reaffirmed within 30 years.

If no renewal or preservation occurs, the encumbrance is eliminated under MRTA.



2. Mobile Homes as Personal Property:

UCC liens on personal property have a much shorter lifespan (5 years unless renewed). The 30-year rule does not apply directly to UCC filings but can indirectly affect older mobile homes if they have been improperly recorded or if the land they sit on is affected by MRTA.

---

### Exceptions to the 30-Year Rule

Certain claims and liens may survive beyond 30 years, such as:

Tax liens or other government claims.

Recorded restrictions specifically preserved within the 30-year period.

Title issues explicitly mentioned in the chain of title or documents like deeds or easements.

---

**Example**

Scenario: A mobile home built in 1980 was permanently affixed to a parcel of land in 1990, and a UCC lien was filed against it in 1991.

In 2024, a buyer conducts a title search.

**Action:**

If no renewal or preservation was made for the lien after 1991, it is extinguished under MRTA because 30 years have passed without preservation.

If the mobile home is classified as personal property, the UCC lien would have already expired after 5 years unless renewed.

---

### Key Takeaways

The 30-year rule under MRTA applies to mobile homes classified as real property but not to those still classified as personal property.

Title examiners must determine whether a mobile home is real or personal property to apply the correct rules.

MRTA clears old claims and encumbrances from title records if they haven’t been reaffirmed or preserved within 30 years.

This makes the classification and documentation of mobile homes critical during a title search.
